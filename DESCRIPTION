Package: hamcrest
Version: 1.0.0
Title: Hamcrest framework for writing unit tests in R
Description: The Hamcrest framework for writing unit tests is based on an assertion function
    and matcher objects. A matcher object implements a single rule that is used by
    the assertion function to perform the test. This package provides a small set
    of matcher objects in the form of functions. The functionality provided by this
    set of matcher objects is identical to those implemented in Renjin, the R
    interpreter for the Java Virtual Machine. The goal of this package is therefore
    to be able to run Renjin's unit tests written in R through the GNU R
    interpreter.
